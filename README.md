Text required: ‚ÄúFood Microbiology Laboratory Manual‚Äù. Attached with this syllabus. 

## Course description:
This laboratory course aims to train students in the laboratory methods used in the microbiological analysis of foods. These experimental methods are used for studying microorganisms involved in food processing and food production environment, quality, and safety. 

## Grading 

| Lab reports (9 total) | 180 points (20 points per report) | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Step-by-step manuals (1 manual)      | 20 points     | 
| Lecture/discussion attendance     | 20 points     | 
| Final exam       | 60 points     | 
| Total  | 280 points     | 

* 5 point will be deducted for  past the due day unless a note to TA is sent ahead of time. This point-deduction rule also applies to your lab reports. For the step-by-step manual, you can choose any paper among the 8 papers we will discuss in the class. 
* Notification to the instructor about any absence from the lecture/discussion/lab is expected. Such notification can be sent via message in Canvas or email. It is expected that the notification will be received before the class starts. If under emergency situation, text message can be sent to 530-852-1660 or can be sent after. 
* The final grades will be A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- based system.

## Lab reports
A lab report needs to be prepared after each lab and it is due 10 days (including weekends) after the lab is completed. Should you need additional time due to reasons, e.g. health emergency, please let Luxin and the TAs know. We are more than happy to work with you on the scheduling of the report due days. A lab report should contain the following parts and will be graded as following:
1.	Title of the lab and your name (1 point).
2.	Introduction and background of the experiment (5 points). At least 4-5 sentences are expected from you to talk about the background and use of the techniques or labs.
3.	A summary paragraph of materials and methods (4 points).
4.	Results. Please present your data in tables or figures and describe them. If you have photos, please also include that. No more than two photos. (8 points). 4-5 sentences for each table/figure.
5.	Discussion. Please discuss your results. Are they what you expected? Why your results are different from what you expected or from others‚Äô results? (2 points). There are also discussion questions after each lab for you to address. Minimum requirement: answer the discussion questions listed after each lab.

## Step by step mannual
A total of eight papers are offered. They are saved in the folder ‚ÄúScientific papers‚Äù in Canvas. You can pick any one out of the eight papers for preparing your step-by-step manuals. The due day of each step-by-step manual is due one week after we discuss that particular paper. You need to email your TA the paper you plan to use for your step-by-step manuals by **April 10th 2023** (failure to do so will lead to -5 points). 
The step-by-step manual contains the following sections (20 points in total per manual):
1.	Original paper‚Äôs title and author information (names of the first author and the corresponding author and their affiliations); 2 points.
2.	Objectives of the study; 1 point.
3.	Materials and supplies used in this study; 5 points. 
4.	Procedures (step-by-step). You can write this section by following the timeline or by following the objectives. 10 points. 
5.	Addressing comments in the revision (2 points). Revision is due one week after you receive feedbacks.

## Before attending the first lab to do list
1. **DO NOT** ring your own lab coat (like the one used in CHEM 2 series), since we will provide you disposable lab coat.
2. First time in a microbiology lab? Afraid of being lost? Don't worry, we got you back. We introduce you **visualized protocl** (VP), which visually demonstrate the steps to complete the lab from begining to end. VP for each lab is listed in this page.
