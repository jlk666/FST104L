## Location and time 
Lectures: Mondays 9:00-9:50 AM (Olson Hall 118)\
Discussion (paper presentation): Wednesdays 9:00-9:50 AM (Olson Hall 118)\
Laboratory: **RMI North 1127**

## Course description:
This laboratory course aims to train students in the laboratory methods used in the microbiological analysis of foods. These experimental methods are used for studying microorganisms involved in food processing and food production environment, quality, and safety.


## Grading 

| Entries |Points total | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Lab reports (9 total)    | 180 points (20 points per report)     | 
| Discussion attendance      | 20 points     | 
| Paper presentation     | 40 points     | 
| Final exam       | 60 points     | 
| Total  | 300 points     | 

* 5 point will be deducted for  past the due day unless a note to TA is sent ahead of time. This point-deduction rule also applies to your lab reports. For the step-by-step manual, you can choose any paper among the 8 papers we will discuss in the class. 
* Notification to the instructor about any absence from the lecture/discussion/lab is expected. Such notification can be sent via message in Canvas or email. It is expected that the notification will be received before the class starts. If under emergency situation, text message can be sent to 530-852-1660 or can be sent after. 
* The final grades will be A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- based system.

## Lab reports
A lab report needs to be prepared after each lab and it is due 10 days (including weekends) after the lab is completed. Should you need additional time due to reasons, e.g. health emergency, please let Luxin and the TAs know. We are more than happy to work with you on the scheduling of the report due days. A lab report should contain the following parts and will be graded as following:
1.	Title of the lab and your name (1 point).
2.	Introduction and background of the experiment (5 points). At least 4-5 sentences are expected from you to talk about the background and use of the techniques or labs.
3.	A summary paragraph of materials and methods (4 points).
4.	Results. Please present your data in tables or figures and describe them. If you have photos, please also include that. No more than two photos. (8 points). 4-5 sentences for each table/figure.
5.	Discussion. Please discuss your results. Are they what you expected? Why your results are different from what you expected or from others‚Äô results? (2 points). There are also discussion questions after each lab for you to address. Minimum requirement: answer the discussion questions listed after each lab.

## Paper presentation
The entire class will be divided into 8 groups. The presentation will be a group presentation focusing on the discussion paper assigned for that week. The presentation will be 40 points. The following sections are expected to be covered in the presentation:


| Presentation component | Points total | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Presentation title (paper title)     | 2 points     | 
| Background and knowledge gap    | 4 points     | 
| Materials and methods    | 10 points     | 
| Results    | 10 points     | 
| Discussion    | 14 points     | 
| Total    | 40 points     | 

* For **Materials and methods** (10 points): Please make step-by-step instructions based on materials and methods section of the paper and make visualization in the flowchart format(You can use source like Biorender.com).
* For **Results** :Please summarize every major findings in the results section of the paper. 
* For **Discussion**: this part should consist of 1. significance of this study paper 2. discussion about the limitations of the paper 3.connections between this paper and the lab for that week.
